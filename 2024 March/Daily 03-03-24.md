## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The goal is to remove the Nth node from the end of a singly-linked list.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I initialized two pointers, `l` and `skip`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
- Moved the `skip` pointer N nodes ahead. If it becomes null during this process, it means the length of the linked list is exactly N. In this case, return `head.next` as we need to remove the head.
- Moved both pointers until the `skip` pointer reaches the end of the linked list.
- Updated the `next` pointer of the node pointed by `l` to skip the Nth node from the end.
- Returned the modified head of the linked list..

My approach utilized two pointers to efficiently find and remove the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments ... Keep Solving.:)
# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(N)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity : $O(1)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

            skip = skip.next;
            
            // If 'skip' becomes null, it means the length of the linked list is exactly n,
            // and I need to remove the head. Return head.next in this case.
            if (skip == null) {

            skip = skip.next;

        }

        l.next = l.next.next;
