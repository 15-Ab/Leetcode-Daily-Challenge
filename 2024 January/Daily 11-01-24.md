## 1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor


# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
My code aims to find the maximum absolute difference between the values of any two nodes in the same path from the root to a leaf in a binary tree. It utilizes a recursive approach to traverse the tree while maintaining the minimum and maximum values encountered along the path.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
**Base Case:**
   - If the root is null, returned 0 as there are no nodes to compare.

**Recursive Calculation:**
   - My `maxAncestorDiff` method takes three parameters: the current node `r`, the minimum value encountered so far `chota`, and the maximum value encountered so far `bara`.
   - Updated `chota` and `bara` based on the current node's value.
   - Calculated the current absolute difference (`currentDifference`) between `bara` and `chota`.

**Recursive Calls for Left and Right Subtrees:**
   - Recursively called `maxAncestorDiff` on the left subtree if it exists and updated `leftChildMax` with the result.
   - Recursively called `maxAncestorDiff` on the right subtree if it exists and updated `rightChildMax` with the result.

**Calculate Maximum Difference:**
   - Calculated the maximum difference from the left and right subtrees (`maxFromChild`).
   - Returned the maximum value among the current path and the subtrees.

**Result:**
   - The result is the maximum absolute difference among the values of any two nodes in the same path from the root to a leaf.

Have a look at the code , still have any confusion then please let me know in the comments Keep Solving.:)
# Complexity
- Time complexity : $O(n)$
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$n$ : number of nodes
- Space complexity : $O(h)$
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
$h$ : height of tree
